      a qualifying location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount

      but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
      statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible
      Product made when selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.) as the payment type at

      the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the
      Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the value of the Apple
